## About The Project


The project implements a ROS node in order to complete the following motion control tasks, by utilizing
feedback from the state of the robot:

* Go to a point in the workspace. Add the goal location as argument to input on the
command-line, such that new goals can be added online.
* Go to a specific pose [x, y, theta] in the world space. Add the goal pose as argument to input
on the command-line, such that new goals can be added online.
* Follow a predefined path. Define a suitable path (e.g., circle, square or something more
complex) and control the robot such that it follows it closely.
